									<h2>Interest to IT</h2>

										<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
										<p>I’ve been around my computers for as long as I can remember, since the age of 2 I have had a personal computer at home (2003) and as a baby I would watch my dad do his work at home sometimes. I watched and caught on quickly how a computer worked and was easily able to use a computer to its full potential by 5 years old. I was given my own account on our computer and used it to play games online through websites like Miniclip, nothing fancy or graphics intensive, just basic racing games and puzzle games. When I was 7, I started playing FPS games non-stop as this was when we got a brand new computer that was capable of running graphic intensive games. So, my love for computers (and FPS games mainly) stemmed from my Dad who has worked in the IT field for about 30 years now, and my passion has stayed because of video games such as Sudden Attack, Maplestory, and Counter Strike from the beginning to League of legends now. My main interest now is still playing video games and talking with my friends online.</p>

										<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
										<p>Close to the end of year 12 I had no idea what course or which university I wanted to study at, I hadn’t given it much thought because nothing stood out in my head. My Dad always said I needed to get a degree so I am qualified to get a good job which is why I knew that going to university was basically a must. I went to the careers lady at my school and said I wasn’t too sure what I wanted to pursue, and she asked me what I like, I said that video games and basketball were my main interests. Obviously pursuing basketball professionally was impossible as I was nowhere near being a star prospect for Australia so that dream was crushed quickly. So, the careers lady said I looked at studying computers or video games, so I chose Information Technology because it would give an insight of the aspects of IT so I could narrow down on my favourite field in IT. The lady said that she recommended Monash, RMIT and Deakin. Deakin atar requirements were low so I used it as a backup plan in case I get a low atar, which thankfully I didn’t. The way I chose between RMIT and Monash was facilities and travel. RMIT was based in the city and Monash was based in Caulfield I believe, although Caulfield was closer by about 15 minutes, I chose RMIT because the facilities looked much newer and the city vibe drew me in. I put RMIT as my first preference and Monash as my second. I was given RMIT in the first round and accepted it and haven’t looked back.</p>

										<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
										<p>I don’t know too much about IT because I have just started my course but by the end, I expect to have a deeper knowledge of what goes on inside a computer, hardware and software wise. From what I’ve experienced so far, programming has been quite difficult as I have been trying to learn Java language from scratch and the assignment gives me a headache sometimes because my code doesn’t work. Computer systems has been quite challenging math wise, but once I can understand the concept then it isn’t too hard to obtain an answer. User centred design has been eye opening to the design process in everything we use everyday and the importance of little aspects in the design process that can make a product successful. Lastly, intro to Information Technology has been the most relatable and has looked at my future possibilities of jobs and how to work towards it. Over these next 2 ½ years I hope to extend my knowledge of IT and come to more of an understanding of what job I want to pursue when my degree is finished.</p>
